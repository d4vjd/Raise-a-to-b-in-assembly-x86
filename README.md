# Raise-a-to-b-in-assembly-x86

- This is an x86 Assembly program written in NASM syntax that calculates the expression (a^b) - 3, where a and b are positive integers entered by the user. 
- The program uses procedures and conditional jumps to check for special cases, such as if a or b are 0 or if a = 2 and b = 1, and display messages accordingly. 
- It implements a loop to raise a to the power of b and stores the result in the memory location "res."
- The result is then displayed character by character. The program has a data segment that defines strings for prompts and messages, and a code segment that contains the main program logic.
